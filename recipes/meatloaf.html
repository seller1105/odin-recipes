    <h4>
        This traditional meatloaf recipe made with sautéed vegetables, spices, and bread crumbs is moist and flavorful and topped with an old-fashioned glaze. Cook time will depend on the size and shape of your loaf, as well as the type of baking pan you use. Serve this hearty meal on cool fall or winter evenings with mashed potatoes and a simple mushroom gravy.

    <ul>
        <li>1 medium carrot, coarsely chopped </li>
        <li>1 rib celery, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>½ medium red bell pepper, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>4 white mushrooms, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li> ½ pounds ground chuck</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking dish with lightly greased foil.</li>
        <li>Place carrot, celery, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, and garlic in a food processor; pulse until very finely chopped, almost to a purée. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add ground chuck to the vegetables, along with Worcestershire sauce, egg, Italian herbs, salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Mix gently with a wooden spoon until ingredients are just combined. Sprinkle in bread crumbs and gently mix with your fingertips until just combined; don't overmix.</li>
        <li>Shape the mixture into a loaf, about 4 inches high by 6 inches across. Place in the prepared baking pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven just until the meatloaf is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
